Hacktoberfest is a massive online event hosted by DigitalOcean every year in October to introduce new people to Open Source Software development and encourage participation.
Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. Whether youâ€™re new to development, a student, long-time contributor, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skills levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.
This is a community-run initiative to help bridge the OSS and Handshake development communities, unaffiliated with DigitalOcean.
